Python Extensions for Abaqus
============================

## Introduction

Abaqus provides powerful Python scripting interface for pre/post processing. However, in real life, it's hard to directly build models using the interfaces provided by Abaqus due to its complexity. I have been writing python scripts for Abaqus for many research projects, while I still can't remember all the commands. This is very similar to Latex -- it's hard for beginners to remember all the commands. A good solution is templates. The main purpose of the library is to collect templates for basic models, e.g. 2D plane strain model, 3D solid model, which can serve as good starting points for more complex real life models.

The second goal of the library is to implement some handy functions which are missing in the original interface. Examples include advanced geometry selection and manipulation, nodes/elements transformation, etc. Those functions will first be implemented in the form of sample scripts and later be integrated a well organized library.
